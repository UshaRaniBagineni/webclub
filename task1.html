<h1>Differnt types of birds</h1>
<body>
    Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves(/'eIvi:z/)'
    characterised by feathers,toothless beaked jaws,the layingof hardshelled eggs,a high metabollic
    rate,a four-chambered heart,and a strong yet lightweight Skeleton.
    Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird
    to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, 
    more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds.
    Birds have wings whose development varies according to species;
    the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.

    Parrots, also known as psittacines (/ˈsɪtəsaɪnz/),[1][2] are birds of the order Psittaciformes
    (/ˈsɪtəsɪfɔːrmiːz/) and are found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. They are made up 
    of four families that contain roughly 410 species in 101 genera. The four families are:
    Psittaculidae (Old World parrots) , the Psittacidae (African and New World parrots),
    the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all parrot 
    species are threatened by extinction, with higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index)
    than any other comparable bird group.[3] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with
    several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well.

    <h1>Eagle</h1>

    Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. 
    Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. 
    True eagles comprise the genus Aquila. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia 
    and Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in North America, 9 in Central 
    and South America, and 3 in Australia.

    Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt
    sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates.

    Hummingbirds are birds native to the Americas and comprise the biological family Trochilidae.
    With about 366 species and 113 genera,[1] they occur from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego,
    but most species are found in Central and South America.[2] About 28 hummingbird species are
    listed as endangered or critically endangered, with numerous species declining in population.[2][3]
    Hummingbirds have varied specialized characteristics to enable rapid, maneuverable flight, 
    exceptional metabolic capacity, adaptations to high altitude, sensitive visual and communication
    abilities, and long-distance migration in some species. Among all birds, male hummingbirds have 
    the widest diversity of plumage color, particularly in blues, greens, and purples.[4]
    Hummingbirds are the smallest mature birds, measuring 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length.

    Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the tribe
    Pavonini of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl are referred to as
    peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, although peafowl of either sex are often 
    referred to colloquially as "peacocks".
    The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian subcontinent,
    and the green peafowl from Southeast Asia;
    the one African species is the Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin.

    Common nightingales are so named because they frequently sing at night as well as during the day.
    The name has been used for more than 1,000 years, being highly recognisable even in its Old English
    form nihtegale, which means "night songstress". Early writers assumed the female sang when it is 
    in fact the male.The song is loud, with an impressive range of whistles, trills and gurgles. Its song is particularly noticeable at night because few other birds are singing. This is why its name includes "night" in several languages. Only unpaired males sing regularly at night,
    and nocturnal song probably serves to attract a mate.
